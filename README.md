# Employee-Tracker

## Description

In Module 12's Challenge, I designed and built a viable solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, console.table and MySQL2. The following functions in this application include:

1. Viewing all Employees, Roles, or Departments  </br>
2. Searching for Employees by Manager  </br>
3. Updating Employees Roles or Manager  </br>
4. Adding Employee, Role, or Department  </br>
5. Removing Employee, Role, or Department  </br>
6. Viewing Department's total utilized budget  </br>
